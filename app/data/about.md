#### Intro
I was born during the Croatian War of Independence. From an early age I had a huge interest in STEM subjects. That led me to participate in multiple mathematics competitions on a regional level, as well as competing in chess. I hold a Bachelor's and Master's Degree in Petroleum Engineering. As a student by winning 5th and 10th place in [FRESHHH](https://molgroupcareers.info/en/students-and-graduates/freshhh-student-competition) and [UPPP](https://molgroupcareers.info/en/students-and-graduates/uppp-student-competition) competitions
I started my career in MOL Group's HQ in Budapest, Hungary. 
Although the work as a petroleum engineer was exciting and diversified (field supervision, engineering analysis, cross-work between various disciplines) the desire to build things and contribute through entrepreneurial endeavors made me change to software development.
